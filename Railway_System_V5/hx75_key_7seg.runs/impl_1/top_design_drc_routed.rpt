2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U1/key_value_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1/key_value_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U1/key_value_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/price_reg[3]_i_13_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/price_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell U2/price_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/price_reg[3]_i_13_0[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/price_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell U2/price_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/price_reg[3]_i_13_0[2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/price_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell U2/price_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U2/price_reg[3]_i_13_0[3] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U2/price_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell U2/price_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
